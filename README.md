## final project
### final project brainstorm
**around the world heatmap**
> suggestion to chart real and, or, fictional circumnavigations around the world, supporting features such as concurrent navigation to compare the timelines of travel
- alternative, major navigations, such as the race to the poles

**strabospot**
> use of strabospot to create a personal photograph map of our local area
- unknown possibilities
    - litter around campus
    - study spots around campus

 **etymology of Wisconsin**
> looking into the history of Wisconsin cultural names origin's in geography or culture

**palimpsest map**
> writing that has been erased and written over, but which is still legible; an exploration of the old maps of our local area or where we call home and how those traces are still etched into our modern day design

**media presence of the globe**
> a cartographic map showing the extent of the global reach marking major regions that would be explored. Additionally, extra layers would be assigned based on:
> - true geographic area
> - english media presence / opinion
> - nepali media presence / opinion
> - spanish media presence / opinion
> These layers would shift the cartogram based on media presence
## final project proposal
> a cartogram showing changes in google trends interest, altering a countries physical geographic size relative to its percent interest for that year. alongside the map, viewers would be presented with highlights from that year in the form of stories for each region through the sequence exploration of the map.

## persona/scenario
### persona
Mary is a normal person who is interested in learning more about how the world and how its focus has shifted to different parts of it over time.
She has a poor understanding of how different regions of the globe **compare** during and over time.
She also has a poor understanding of how important countries are viewed (**ranked**) relative to eachother.
### scenario
Using our website, she will gain a better idea of **trends** and **patterns** over time as she explores the map through **sequence** and **retieve** operators.
Our stories will highlight **outliers** and **anomalies** using the **sequence** operator as a means of demonstating points of interest throughout the map and timeline.
She may also begin to develop **associations** between certain countries' relationships in the trends.
## requirements document
**Scope:** a brief history of global shifts in focus through the past 16 years.
## wireframes
to be determined (drawn)
