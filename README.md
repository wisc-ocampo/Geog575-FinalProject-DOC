## project overview
This is the final project submission for Geography 575
under Professor Robert Roth.

What we are presenting here is a visualization of how global interest has
shifted across different countries over the years, represented by global
**Google Trends** data. Here, we have compiled all interest values for every
country (using Natural Earth, 1:110m as a reference). In doing so, we have 
organized data by representing the peak monthly values for each of the last 20 
years, 2004 through 2023. This data has then been expressed on both a
**proportional cartogram, a choropleth, and a line graph**. Additionally, we 
added some information regarding what events may have sparked such interest for 
that country. In doing so, we aim to present what sort of events the world tends 
to care about most.

And then, we go one step further. Because Google Trends data is a relative 
value, that means every country's interest percentage (0-100) is made in 
relation to the greatest spike of interest across any country in the last 
20 years. Thus, every value is a relative percentage of the search interest 
for the United States in November of 2020. This spike is so great that even 
the United States struggles to retain interest values above 50%; likewise, many 
other spikes in interest for other countries are crushed by this data and 
a Western-centric world. Therefore, we have combed back through the data and 
gathered the values in each region of the world relative to the local peak 
in its region. In doing we, we discovered many more spikes in the data and 
marked new points of interest in the line graph that were obscured by the 
utter dominance of the global spike in interest in the United States. Users
are able to access this data through the toggle button in the corner, just 
above the sequential slider that moves users through the years.

## theoretical users
### target user profile (persona)
**name and position:**
> Mary; *One Vision, One World* NGO; Community Manager

**background description:**
Mary is an anthropologist and an activist who was newly hired as the 
community manager for an non-governmental organization based in the United 
States interested in promoted more equitable relations between all countries.
As part of this work, one of her major goals is to establish and promote 
interest for under-represented regions of the globe; unfortunately, it is 
difficult to communicate to outsiders how skewed their view of the world is. 
Additionally, it is also difficult to understand what events peak global 
interest or promote care for others far away from their country. In other 
words, she desires a presentation that allows the public to easily *identify* 
their skewed worldview. Furthermore, she hopes the tool can aid her team in 
*comparing* and *ranking* inequalities in representation (in the public mind) 
to better plan interventions promoting a more ethnorelativistic view. Through 
this, she plans to develop *insights* about the Western-centric worldview, such 
as which countries are *better or worse off* because of it and which regions 
have many *anomalies* or *outliers*. Finally, she desires the map to be 
flexible enough to accommodate changes in audience, such as being able to 
delineate into specific regions, making a distinction between *inside* and 
*outside groups*, aiding in seeing trends obscured by the complete dominance 
of the United States on the world stage.

### user case scenario
Mary has been offered the opportunity to attend a local school district meeting 
centered around social studies and history. The school district is looking for 
more engaging ways for students to learn about the world and is especially 
looking for some means that can be easily used while also leading students to 
understand how little of the rest of the world they may know about. Therefore, 
Mary comes in to show the teachers her project and teach them about how to use 
it within the classroom. When she opens the project, she also asks others to 
follow along. She goes through the "help" pop-up that first appears, clarifying 
a few questions about the data. Meanwhile, others are already exploring the map 
and making unique discoveries of their own. They are immediately struck by how 
small most of the world appears, *identifying* global biases. They click and 
*retrieve* a few points of interest from the graph, sliding the map towards the 
year of the event they found. Finally, they see another button just above the 
slider and click it. This button shows the world, map, and line chart to be a 
much busier place, and they start *comparing* the two views, switching the 
toggle back and forth. In doing so, they also realize that the points of 
interest are changing on the chart; they begin discovering events that they had 
never heard about and begin to try comparing the places and events the world 
knows about against those that got very little attention outside of their 
region.
